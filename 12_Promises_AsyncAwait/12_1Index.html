    <h1>Promise in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>A Promise works is in 3 states </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pending</li>
        <li>Fulfilled</li>
        <li>Rejected</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Fetch API</h2>
    <p>The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a
        <b>Promise</b> that resolves to the <b>Response</b> to that request — as soon as the server responds with
        headers —<b> even if the server response is an HTTP error status</b>. You can also optionally pass in an init
        options object as the second argument.
